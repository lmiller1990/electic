        Vue 3 has a new feature called "Suspense". I find the naming to be a bit unintuitive - I had no idea what to expect when I first heard the name. I feel like a more descriptive name would be "LoadWithFallback" (although not as sexy). Anyway, today we will explore this new feature by building a simple app that shows some Covid19 (aka coronavirus) data.

      <div class="intro">
        UI Libraries like Vue and React and their Testing libraries, Vue Test Utils and Enzyme, can seem like "magic" sometimes. To remove this magic and see exactly how a test framework works, let's build a simple unit testing framework for Vue.js 3, from scratch. Will will see that testing frameworks are just simple wrappers that provide an abstraction around basic usual DOM APIs.

      <div class="intro">
        Vue 3's alpha has been out for a while now, however most of the core libraries have not caught up yet - namely Vuex and Vue Router. Vuex, in particular, is fairly simple to implement with the new APIs exposed by Vue, namely `reactive` and `computed`. In this article, we will build a Vuex replacement (let's called it Hackex).

      </a>

      <div class="intro">
        One common occurrence I've observed across large Vue and React apps is that, over time, the UI logic and business logic becomes so entangled that UI changes break the business logic and vice versa. Let's look at an example of this, and how we can separate the concerns.

        20180501 ActiveRecord and the Database
      </a>

      <div class="intro">
        If you do things the Rails Way, including using the standard table names that come with the migrations generated using `rails generate migration`, you barely need to think about the underlying database. If you are interfacing with an existing database, or your models and the corresponding tables have different names, it can be a little more tricky. Luckily, ActiveRecord lets us specify the table, keys, and so on in these situations.

      <div class="intro">
        My previous article discussed how to setup a simple GraphQL server and query it from a Vue frontend. For my personal projects, I believe this is adequate, however a more common solution in complex, production applications is a framework to bring some structure and extra features to your stack. Apollo is one such framework.
