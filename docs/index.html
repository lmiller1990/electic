      ActiveRecord and the Database
    </a>

    <div class="intro">
      If you do things the Rails Way, including using the standard table names that come with the migrations generated using `rails generate migration`, you barely need to think about the underlying database. If you are interfacing with an existing database, or your models and the corresponding tables have different names, it can be a little more tricky. Luckily, ActiveRecord lets us specify the table, keys, and so on in these situations.

Apollo is one such framework.
