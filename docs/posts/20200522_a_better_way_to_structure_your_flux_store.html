    20200522 A better way to structure your flux store
  </h1>

  <div class="post_body">
    <p>This article discusses flux-entities, an abstraction I noticed after working on many different Vuex/Redux apps over the last few years. A more technical explanation and some example app can be found <a href="https://github.com/lmiller1990/flux-entities">on the GitHub page</a>.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>I have worked with many companies who are using Vue and React, and almost all the Vue apps are using Vuex, and a number of React apps use Redux. Despite the consistency of a flux store, every single one has been dramatically different in structure. What’s more, each “slice” of the state in each of these apps was basically arbitrary - the developers just created whatever fields were needed at the time, with little regard for consistency or maintainability.</p>
<p>Finally, a lot of these apps were written in JavaScript, not TypeScript, so without documentation or intricate knowledge of the application, knowing what data you were working with was very difficult. </p>
<p>Let’s look at one example, a small company building an esports analytics website. - it would show past, ongoing or upcoming games. When I joined, the front-end was hacked together in Vue by a few inexperienced designers. The fact they got this far with very little JS experience is a tribute to how powerful Vue is. Anyway, on to the Vuex store. Basically what the <code class="inline">src/store/games.js</code> looked like this:</p>
<pre><code class="js lang-js language-js">// src/store/games.js
const games = {
  state: {
    games: []
    currentGame: {},
    loaded: false,
    teamId: null
  }

  // a ton of mutations and actions and getters
}</code></pre>
<p>This was basically a “god store” than held about 75% of the data in the app.</p>
<p>At first, it was very difficult to work on this app. There is no way to know what a <code class="inline">game</code> looks like, or when/how the <code class="inline">games</code> array is used. To represent a selected game, it was copied from the array into the <code class="inline">currentGame</code> object. This was to avoid looping 1000s of games to find the one that is currently selected.</p>
<p>There was no guidelines to how or where to save data, and things quickly became very difficult to reason about, and code turned to spaghetti.</p>
<p>There was also many other states in the store, other than game, but they most contained duplicated data, either too deep in the <code class="inline">games</code> array or just because it was easier that way. For example <code class="inline">src/store/teams.js</code> and <code class="inline">players.js</code></p>
<pre><code class="js lang-js language-js">// teams.js
const teams = {
  firstTeam: null,
  secondTeam: null,
  currentTeam: {}
}

// players.js
const players = {
  data: [],
  selected: null
}</code></pre>
<p>You can kind of guess what these might do. Turns the <code class="inline">teams</code> store also contained duplicates of players, with an array of games… things were messy.</p>
<p>This app, like many others, ultimately just wants to render lists, or a subset of a list. Considering this, and other apps I’ve worked on, I arrived at this list of thinsg we should optimize our store for:</p>
<ul>
<li>store a list of data
</li>
<li>keep track of load states (loading/loaded/error etc)
</li>
<li>keep track of a selected entity or object (in the above example, selected player/game)
</li>
</ul>
<p>With this knowledge, and armed with TypeScript (although not necessary) I arrived at a pattern I call <code class="inline">flux-entities</code>. I wrote about it <a href="https://github.com/lmiller1990/flux-entities">in the library README</a>. Let’s expand on it with an example here, and make this esports app great again (although I don’t think it exists anymore).</p>
<h2>Avoiding duplicated data; Keep your state flat!</h2>
<p>The main problem I noticed is duplicating data throughout the flux store. In the above example, we have something like:</p>
<pre><code class="js lang-js language-js">// games store
const games = {
  games: [
    {
      id: 1,
      teams: [
        {
          id: 1,
          name: &#39;...&#39;,
          players: [
            {
              id: 1,
              name: &#39;...&#39;
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>
<p>Which represents the upcoming games. So far so good. This is fine when we are rendering a list of games. <code class="inline">v-for=&quot;game in games&quot;</code>… suddenly, there was a request to add a feature where you could click a player, and see details stats, like their last 20 games. The solution at the time was to create a <code class="inline">player.js</code> store, hit an endpoint to get a response like this:</p>
<pre><code class="js lang-js language-js">[
  {
    id: 2,
    kills: 5,
    deaths: 2,
    team: {
      id: 4,
      result: &#39;win&#39;
    }
  }
]</code></pre>
<p>This went in the <code class="inline">player.js</code> store, which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="js lang-js language-js">const player = {
  id: 1,
  name: &#39;...&#39;,
  careerKills: 1000,
  kda: 5.1,
  games: [] // past games and stats
}</code></pre>
<p>The problem is we are now duplicating data - we have some overlap in <code class="inline">games</code> and player stats. This can lead to inconsistencies on the UI, and just a very confusing application to work on. Another problem the <code class="inline">games</code> array was large - even if you know the id of the selected game, you need to iterate over a large array to find it.</p>
<p>The solution is avoid nested state - refer to relationships using ids. I arrived at something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="js lang-js language-js">const games = {
  all: {
    &#39;1&#39;: {
      redTeamId: &#39;1&#39;,
      blueTeamId: &#39;2&#39;,
      winnerId: &#39;1&#39;
    }
  },
  ids: [&#39;1&#39;]
}

const teams = {
  all: {
    &#39;2&#39;: {
      name: &#39;...&#39;,
      players: [&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;]
    }
  },
  ids: [&#39;2&#39;]
}

const players = {
  all: {
    &#39;1&#39;: {
      name: &#39;...&#39;,
      currentTeam: &#39;1&#39;,
      previousTeams: [&#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;]
    },
  },
  ids: [&#39;1&#39;]
}</code></pre>
<p>Firstly, each state has the same shape. This won’t work for all parts of your state, but it might for a lot of them - it has for me. Making each state similar makes it more predictable, allows you to share utility methods, and makes things more consistent in general.</p>
<p>The other thing to notice is we have no nested data, and no duplication. This solves a lot of problems. Furthermore, we are saving the data in an object called <code class="inline">all</code>, which is a key value map, instead of an array. We keep the <code class="inline">ids</code> in an array. This has a few benefits.</p>
<p>If you want to render a list of games, you just do</p>
<pre><code class="html lang-html language-html">&lt;div v-for=&quot;id in $store.state.games.ids&quot;&gt;
  {{ $store.state.games.all[id] }}
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If you want to access a specific game, add a <code class="inline">selectedId</code> to the state. Now, instead of searching for it by looping over the <code class="inline">games</code> array, you can just do:</p>
<pre><code class="html lang-html language-html">&lt;div v-if=&quot;$store.state.games.all[$store.state.games.selectedI]&quot;&gt;
  {{ $store.state.games.all[$store.state.games.selectedId] }}
&lt;div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This is good! If you have 1000 games, access a specific one is an <code class="inline">O(n)</code> operation - worst case, you have to check 999 other games. By using an object, it’s an <code class="inline">O(1)</code> operation.</p>
<p>If this seems verbose - it is. Define a helper - if you are using TypeScript, you get type-safety, too (<code class="inline">flux-entities</code> is written in TypeScript for this reason):</p>
<pre><code class="ts lang-ts language-ts">function selectedEntity(state) {
  return state.all[state.selectedId]
}</code></pre>
<p>Now you just use a computed property:</p>
<pre><code class="js lang-js language-js">computed: {
  selectedGame() {
    return selectedEntity(this.$store.state.games)
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Since all your stores look the same, you can reuse <code class="inline">selectedEntity</code> for all of them.</p>
<h2>TypeScript to the rescue</h2>
<p>Formally, we can define this <code class="inline">all</code> and <code class="inline">ids</code> combo like this with TypeScript:</p>
<pre><code class="ts lang-ts language-ts">const games = {
  all: Record&lt;string, Game&gt;
  ids: string[]
}

const players = {
  all: Record&lt;string, Player&gt;
  ids: string[]
}</code></pre>
<p>Putting them into an interface we can reuse:</p>
<pre><code class="ts lang-ts language-ts">interface BaseState&lt;T&gt; {
  all: Record&lt;string, T&gt;
  ids: string[]
}</code></pre>
<p>Now you just do:</p>
<pre><code class="ts lang-ts language-ts">const games: BaseState&lt;Game&gt; = {
  all: {},
  ids: []
}</code></pre>
<p>We can upgrade our <code class="inline">selectedEntity</code> helper too:</p>
<pre><code class="ts lang-ts language-ts">function selectedEntity&lt;T&gt;(state: BaseState&lt;T&gt;) {
  return state.all[state.selectedId]
}</code></pre>
<p>And you get type-safety.</p>
<h3>Load States</h3>
<p>The other problem I often encounter was knowing when data has been loaded. Most apps have some kind of <code class="inline">loading</code> or <code class="inline">loaded</code> key in the state. The main situations I encountered in the esports app was:</p>
<ul>
<li>has the initial data loaded? (just show a spinner until then)
</li>
<li>did an error occur (show an error message)
</li>
<li>are we currently loading data?
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many apps use a combination of local component state and Vuex/Redux state. I ended up settling on these four keys in each of my state:</p>
<pre><code class="js lang-js language-js">const games = {
  all: {},
  ids: [],

  // for tracking load states
  touched: false,
  errors: [],
  loading: false,
  ready: false
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline">touched</code> represents whether the initial data load has been triggered. If it is <code class="inline">false</code>, normally we want to trigger an API call
</li>
<li><code class="inline">errors</code> is used when some error occurs. Often this might just be something like <code class="inline">[&#39;403: Access forbidden&#39;]</code>, but having an array gives flexibility. The app I work on now days is a medical device, and often we get several errors such as <code class="inline">[&#39;Patient weight is outside the model&#39;, &#39;Dose is too high&#39;]</code> for example.
</li>
<li><code class="inline">loading</code> indicates an API request is in progress. Usually we want to show a spinner.
</li>
<li><code class="inline">ready</code> indicates the initial API request has finished, and we can show the UI to the user.
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also use a number of helpers such as <code class="inline">isLoaded</code>, <code class="inline">isReady</code>, which just compute the state based on the status of <code class="inline">touched</code>, <code class="inline">errors</code> etc. Some parts of your store might not need these, if they are not storing data that is fetched from an API.</p>
<p>You can define a reusable interface using TypeScript for this, too:</p>
<pre><code class="ts lang-ts language-ts">interface AjaxState {
  touched: boolean
  errors: string[]
  loading: boolean
  ready: boolean
}</code></pre>
<h2>Composing States</h2>
<p>I use TypeScript, and the above architecture lends itself well to defining types using TypeScript. For example, since <code class="inline">flux-entities</code> has the interfaces mentioned above:</p>
<pre><code class="ts lang-ts language-ts">interface BaseState&lt;T&gt; {
  ids: string[]
  all: Record&lt;string, T&gt;
}</code></pre>
<p>This is used for the <code class="inline">all</code> and <code class="inline">ids</code> part. <code class="inline">flux-entities</code> also has a <code class="inline">SelectableState</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="ts lang-ts language-ts">interface SelectableState {
  selectedId?: string
}</code></pre>
<p>And <code class="inline">AjaxState</code>, which we defined above, with <code class="inline">touched</code>, <code class="inline">errors</code>, <code class="inline">ready</code> and <code class="inline">loading</code>.</p>
<p>If you need all three of those keys, you combine them:</p>
<pre><code class="ts lang-ts language-ts">interface UserState extends BaseState&lt;User&gt;, SelectableState, AjaxState {}</code></pre>
<p>Better yet - use the built in interface that combines all three: <code class="inline">AjaxBaseSelectableState</code>.</p>
<p>Or mix and match as needed. You can read more about this architecture <a href="https://github.com/lmiller1990/flux-entities">on the GitHub page</a>, which also has some examples with Vue/Vuex, React/Redux, and vanilla js, or watch the accompanying screencast.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This article primarily focused on my experience with Flux stores and the solution I abstracted. The most important point, though, is not the library or even my personal opinion on how your Flux store should look, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>consistency is key! Find common patterns and extract them. Make guidelines to allow your flux store and app to scale
</li>
<li>avoid duplicating data. Keeping a flat state is a good way to do this. Treat it like a relational database - relate entities with ids, or <strong>references</strong>, not by copy and pasting data across stores.
</li>
<li>a <strong>single source of truth</strong> is key to success with Vue/React and a flux store.
</li>
</ul>
