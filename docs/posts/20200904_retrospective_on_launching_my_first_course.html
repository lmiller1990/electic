    20200904 Retrospective on Launching my First Course
  </h1>

  <div class="post_body">
    <p>I have been working on my website and course, Vue.js: The Composition API since early 2020. Here is the timeline, how much money I made, and some of my learnings.</p>
<p>Check it out my on website, <a href="https://vuejs-course.com/">Vue.js Course</a>.</p>
<h2>The Idea</h2>
<p>I had the idea to create a course for Vue.js 3; it’s new (still in release candidate at the time of this post) and people will be interested in learning the new features. </p>
<p>The main changes are</p>
<ul>
<li>better TypeScript support
</li>
<li>some new components (Suspense, Portal)
</li>
<li>the Composition API
</li>
</ul>
<p>I enjoy fast paced, technical content, so that’s the style I am going for. The main thing that makes my course different is the emphasis on unit testing; most courses don’t go into this.</p>
<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>I made a basic landing page; it was just a single .html file on GH pages. It has a little form for people to submit their email for notifications. I got around 100 emails/month. I’d say 95% of traffic comes from my book, the <a href="https://lmiller1990.github.io/vue-testing-handbook/">Vue Testing Handbook</a>. It averages about 80k views a month.</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>At the time (Jan/Feb 2020) neither Vuex, Vue Router or Test Utils had Vue 3 support. Vuex and Vue Router had maintainers, but Test Utils not so much. I ended up becoming the maintainer of Test Utils, and spend a ton of time updating it to work with Vue 3. This also makes me reputable; I think people will be more likely to puchase a course on Vue testing from the creator of the official testing library.</p>
<p>I also practiced screencasting by making a new <a href="https://vuejs-course.com/screencasts">screencast every week</a>. I also paywalled them after I had a decent amount - this validated whether people would buy my content. More on this later.</p>
<h2>Content Creation</h2>
<p>This took a long time. I spent about 2 weeks building the demo app. I then planned all the modules.</p>
<p>Recording was slow at first. It would take me around 1h to record a 5-8 minute video. My standards were (too) high. That said, I got faster and better. </p>
<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>I finished 4/6 modules by May, and decided to do an early release at a discounted rate to see if my product was going to sell. See below for results.</p>
<p>I also posted regularly (usually once a week) on reddit with free screencasts. I left a link in the description about my website and course.</p>
<h2>Sales</h2>
<p>Here are my sales. I went live around May, and released the full course at the start of July. Sales were quite consistent. I did a few email campaigns. Once on prerelease (May, first 4 modules) one on release, and 1 more including a discount code as well as some free content to boot.</p>

<h3>Figure 2: Sales by Day</h3>

<p>So far things are going well. You can see the spikes in May and July where I did my email campaign.  I’ve made around $2600 USD in 4 months or so. The amount of actual time invested into this was significant - I really started in January. </p>
<h2>Retrospective</h2>
<p>I had a ton of fun making the content and learned a lot. I am working on another course, the Vue.js Complete Crash Course. Recording this is much quicker for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m faster and recording and make less mistakes
</li>
<li>Not as much of a perfectionist
</li>
<li>Less time planning, more time DOING
</li>
</ul>
<p>I spend too much time planning my previous course. I should have just had a basic outline and gone with that. That is my current approach for the Complete Vue.js Crash Course. I am going to try putting that one on Udemy. I also started a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydNBt-h2Cox_Ub_GzspneQ">YouTube</a> and am trying that out as a promotion channel.</p>
