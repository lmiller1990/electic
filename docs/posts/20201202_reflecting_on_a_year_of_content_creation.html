    20201202 Reflecting on a Year of Content Creation
  </h1>

  <div class="post_body">
    <p>In 2020, I decided to start taking content creation more seriously. This post will detail my content creation journey, which started in 2017. I will share the different things I tried, what I learned, and how much I made.</p>
<h2>2017</h2>
<p>I’ve been posting content online since mid 2017, when I started writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@lachlanmiller_52885">Medium</a>, which was <em>the</em> place to post content at the time, where I main wrote about JavaScript and Vue.js. </p>
<p>Around this time I also started contributing to <a href="https://github.com/eddyerburgh/avoriaz">Avoriaz</a>, which later became <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils">Vue Test Utils</a>. Since there were not many articles about how to test Vue components, I started writing some on my Medium blog. </p>
<p>After a while, I had quite a few articles about Vue testing. To make it easier for people to navigate them, I put them into a small book which I named <a href="https://lmiller1990.github.io/vue-testing-handbook/v3/">The Vue Testing Handbook</a>. This was around mid 2018.</p>
<p>After this, I continued to write articles about whatever I was interested in at the time - mainly testing. I try to write about topics not many people are covering - there is a huge amount of beginner material, like “how to Hello World with XYZ framework” but not nearly enough advanced content.</p>
<h2>2018</h2>
<p>In 2018 I dicovered <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">Destroy All Software</a>. I loved the speed and brevity of Gary’s presentations, as well as his focus on advanced concepts. It was a breath of fresh air among the endless “Hello World” style videos on YouTube and posts on Medium. </p>
<p>I also did a couple of courses on Udemy during 2018 - a React one, since I started a new job with React, and another on Redux. Udemy has some great content - you just need to search. Most of the courses I took were between $15 and $45. Some of those courses had 1000s of students - even at $10 each, those people were making tons of moeny!? I wondered if I could do that.</p>
<p>Around this time checked the Google Analytics for my Vue Testing Handbook. It had a ton of traffic! It got around 100k views in 2018:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmiller1990/electic/master/screenshots/content-ss-2018.png" alt="2018 views on my book" /></p>
<p align="center">2018 traffic for the Vue Testing Handbook</p><p>This felt awesome - people were finding my content useful! I continued to add content and improve it as I saw fit. Since I was one of the main contributors to Vue Test Utils, I had a good idea of the problems people were facing, which helped drive a lot of the content.</p>
<h2>2019</h2>
<p>2019 saw a <em>huge</em> spike in traffic to my book:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmiller1990/electic/master/screenshots/content-ss-2019.png" alt="2019 biews on my book" /></p>
<p align="center">2019 traffic for the Vue Testing Handbook</p><p>You can see where I broke Google Analytics in November when I bumped the dependencies. Since I had a lot of traffic, I tried putting a small advertisement in the top right hand corner of the book with <a href="https://www.carbonads.net/">Carbon Ads</a>. Even with 100k views / month, I only got around $15. I have no idea if this is normal or due to heavy use of adblockers by developers, but I was sure I could make more than $15 a month with this much traffic.</p>
<p>Around this time Evan announced plans for <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/roadmap#3x">Vue 3</a>. I had the idea to make a course. I didn’t want it to be for beginners, there are TONS of those out there already. I decided it would be more advanced and focus on TypeScript and the Composition API (Vue 3’s flagship features) and testing with Vue Test Utils, the library which I maintain. </p>
<h2>2020</h2>
<p>I had just finished reading <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">The Lean Startup</a> and decided to follow it’s philosophy. I made a little graphic and stuck it on my book with a link to my <a href="https://vuejs-course.com">course’s website</a>. There wasn’t anything there yet other than a few dot points about the course I was going to make and a form to let people submit their email. I got about 100 email registration in the first month - validation successful.</p>
<p>There were a few blockers on making my course:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vue 3 was not released.
</li>
<li>I was not good at screencasting. 
</li>
<li>Vue Test Utils for Vue 3 did not exist.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Evan and the rest of the team were working on (1), so that was fine. </p>
<h2>Learning to Screencast</h2>
<p>Regarding (2) - I decided I could practice and drive traffic at the same time. I created a new 10m - 20m screencast every week for almost 6 months, and wrote an accompanying blog post. You can see the screencasts <a href="https://vuejs-course.com/screencasts">here</a>. To see if people would pay for my content, I made it a $20, one off payment. I really dislike the subscription model for educational content - it just seems silly. Why should I need to pay a recurring payment for a course? WTF? This is why I like Udemy - the model is good for consumers. One off payments are good.  </p>
<p>I posted this opinion on Twitter and got beaten to a pulp - mainly by people running subscription platforms, lol. I don’t care what anyone says, I don’t want a recurring fee to take a one off course, and neither does anyone else.</p>
<p>Anyway, some people paid for the screencasts. Since I was mainly using it to drive traffic and learn to screencast, the goal was not to turn a profit. I made the most recent few free, and the rest cost. So if you visited my site each week, you could watch all the content as it came out without paying.</p>
<p>Either way, some people found the content useful and paid for it. Further validation people enjoyed my content AND were willing to pay. And I was getting better at screencasting.</p>

<p align="center">Screencast Revenue</p><p>Here’s a typical example of my screencasts:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/456395472?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p align="center">Building a Spreadsheet Engine and UI Layer with TypeScript and Vue.js 3</p><h2>Building a Brand</h2>
<p>I also started to share my content on the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/vuejs">Vue.js subreddit</a>. I post there most days anyway, answering questions and helping people out - I think it’s important that I do this, so I don’t just seem like someone who shares their content and doesn’t actually participate in the community.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmiller1990/electic/master/screenshots/content-ss-reddit.png" alt="My Reddit profile" /></p>
<p align="center">Sharing content on Reddit</p><p>I also started posting on <a href="https://twitter.com/Lachlan19900">Twitter</a>. I didn’t like Twitter much before, I don’t like it much now, but a lot of developers hang out there and it’s a great way to build a brand. Building a brand is super important if you want to get into content creation, as I learned from <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/intentional-career-building">Kent C Dodds</a>, who is a prolific blogger and <a href="https://twitter.com/garybernhardt">Gary Bernhardt</a> who presents at conferences.</p>
<h2>Building Vue Test Utils for Vue.js 3</h2>
<p>Another blocker on making my course was I needed to build the testing library I had written my book about, Vue Test Utils, for Vue 3. This was actually pretty challenging, since the Vue 3 internals are really different from Vue 2, and a lot of the hacks in <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils">Vue Test Utils v1</a> would not work in <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils-next">Vue Test Utils v2</a>. I basically built the features for the library as I needed them for my course.</p>
<h2>Course Pre-release</h2>
<p>I recorded about 4-5 lectures every week on Sunday for a few months. The course had 6 modules, and after I finished 4 I decided to let people buy the content. I also made the first 7 lectures free. I let people know via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vuejs/comments/g3kszg/vuejs_3_the_composition_api_course_first_seven/">Reddit</a> as well as emailing everyone who’d signed up (around 500 people). </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmiller1990/electic/master/screenshots/content-ss-vuejs-course.png" alt="Course Sales" /></p>
<p align="center">Course Sales on my Website</p><p>You can see two spikes in sales - pre-release (June) and the full release (July). Around 70 people purchased the course on my site for a total of $3000 USD in sales. This was really exciting to me - the fact people are willing to pay to listen to me talk about coding is thrilling. I still can’t believe I get paid to code all day. </p>
<p>I decided to self publish. I am not sure this was a bad decision, but it was a LOT of extra work. I had to build a website with authentication, set up Stripe, host my content on Vimeo … this took a  lot of time and effort I could have spent on other things, like producing my course.</p>
<p>Marketing is also challenging - I don’t want to spam people, so I try to keep emails to a minimum, and always include something free (like some new screencasts).</p>
<p>I decided to publish my course on Udemy, too, at the same price. One of the challenges I had with self publishing is purchasing power parity - while people in rich countries can easily pay $50 for a course, many people cannot afford this amount. Udemy had tiered pricing based on country, which is nice. I want my content to be available to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Udemy is less profitable, but also takes WAY less overhead - no website to manage, no video hosting to mess around with.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmiller1990/electic/master/screenshots/content-ss-udemy-1.png" alt="Course Sales on Udemy" /></p>
<p align="center">Course Sales on Udemy</p><p>The average sale price is around $18, as opposed to $40 on my website. I think this is a good trade off, though - I only spend 1-2 hours a month answering questions on Udemy, and 0 time maintaining infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Making Another Course</h2>
<p>I learned a LOT from making my first course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t spend too much time re-recording videos - they will never be perfect. Make them good, but don’t obsess.
</li>
<li>Marketing is important. Start it early, even before you have any content.
</li>
<li>Personal brand is important.
</li>
<li>Stand out. Do something different. Unless you are the king of your niche. My niche is testing Vue.js components.
</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to put this into action and try making a crash course for Vue.js 3. Since Vue 3 was just coming out, there were not many courses yet.</p>
<p>My first course took me around 4 months to complete. The second only took around 6 weeks! This was mainly due to getting better at screencasting. I made this one $30 on both my website and Udemy, to see which did better.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmiller1990/electic/master/screenshots/content-ss-crash.png" alt="Crash Course Sales on my site" /></p>

<p align="center">Vue.js Crash Course Sales on Udemy</p><p>Udemy is king when it comes to beginner content. And yes - <em>13000 enrollments</em>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I made a crash course about Vue.js 3. It&#39;s **FREE** for the next 3 days! 🎉 <br>You can learn basic Vue 3, Vite, Options/Composition API, basic Vuex and Vue Router.

The tweet went viral! I could refresh the page and watch enrollments jump by 10 every time. If this had been my own site, and not Udemy, it would certainly have crashed under the load.</p>
<p>Lesson learned - free stuff is the best marketing.</p>
<h2>New Website, Writing a Book</h2>
<p>One of the problems with making courses is it is difficult to revise them. Vue.js 3 had a few minor breaking changes in the early days, and I had to re-record several lectures. </p>
<p>I had also made my website, <a href="https://vuejs-course.com">Vue.js Course</a> for my original course - the domain name isn’t exactly ideal - you don’t go to a website called Vue.js Course expecting screencasts or blog posts. Also, I realized there is a lot more value than a couple thousand bucks in building my own brand.</p>
<p>I decided to create a new website, one that was more <a href="https://lachlan-miller/me">focused on my own brand</a>. I also got a little better at design :)</p>
<p>I also decided to write a book - I had a great time writing the Vue Testing Handbook. Also, books are easier to maintain and update. </p>
<p>To remove the additional work of maintaining a website with a full payment system, I decided to sell my book on <a href="https://gum.co/vuejs-design-patterns">Gumroad</a>. It would be focused on design patterns for Vue.js.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmiller1990/design-patterns-for-vuejs-source-code/master/banner.jpg" alt="https://lachlan-miller.me/design-patterns-for-vuejs" /></p>
<p>In true lean spirit, I slapped together a <a href="https://lachlan-miller.me/design-patterns-for-vuejs">marketing page</a> and put a banner on the Vue Testing Handbook to let people know about my upcoming book. In total I have around 1000 people on my mailing list now!</p>
<p>I listened to <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan’s</a> interview on Indie Hackers. One thing that stuck with me something to the meaning of “build excitement - let people know what you are doing”. Every time I wrote a new chapter for my book, I’d sent it out for free to my subscribers. </p>
<p>I got a TON of really useful feedback! Lesson learned again - the best marketing is free content. I also used Twitter to marketing my new blog posts and book. Some people even asked how I was going with the book, and when it would be released! It felt great, but also a bit scary!</p>
<p>It took me two months to write the book. I also started a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LachlanMiller">YouTube channel</a> in parallel. Initially I had the idea to sell some screencasts as part of the package, like <a href="https://michaelnthiessen.com/clean-components">Michael Thiessen</a> in his course, Clean Components, which is known to be a great product. </p>
<p>I ended up just posting all the screencasts I made for free on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LachlanMiller">YouTube</a>, and dropped a link to my upcoming book in the description. </p>
<p>The reason for this was two-fold: free content is good marketing, and building an audience on YouTube might be useful eventually. I got around 500 subscribers in 3 months, which is really exciting. Most of my subscribers came from sharing my videos on Reddit or sharing them with my emailing list when sending out free chapters from my book.</p>
<p>I am getting better at screencasting. I am learning to speak clearly, and type while I explaining things. Here’s one of my more recently screencasts:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzR00-I3YSE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Launching my Book</h2>
<p>I really want to make my book available to as many people as possible, so I implemented purchasing power parity on my marketing page. You get an appropriate price based on your location using <a href="https://purchasing-power-parity.com/">this API</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmiller1990/electic/master/screenshots/content-ss-ppp.png" alt="Purchasing Power Parity" /></p>
<p align="center">Purchasing power parity</p><p>Of course this is able to be spoofed - luckily most people are honest, and the base price ($30) is reasonable. I also sent out a $5 discount for all the people in my emailing list.</p>
<p>I sold 68 copies of my book in the first few days!</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmiller1990/electic/master/screenshots/content-ss-gumroad.png" alt="Book sales" /></p>
<p align="center">Book sales</p><p>Experience and research tells me most of the sales are in the first few weeks - I don’t expect this number to increase much more. I’m still really happy with the result - I wrote my first book, and made around $1400!</p>
<p>I paid a designer on Behance around $150 to get a really cool cover made. I love it. The bird is a Kookabarra - a native Australian bird (I am from Australia).</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmiller1990/design-pattenrns-for-vuejs/master/assets/covers/Vue.js_cover.png" alt="Book cover" /></p>
<p align="center">Cover for Design Patterns for Vue.js</p><h2>Stats and Total Profit</h2>
<p>My two goals of content creation were building a stronger personal brand and making some side income.</p>
<p>I accumulated around 620 Twitter follows over 11 months, and  510 YouTube subscribers over 3 months. YouTube is WAY more enjoyable for me, and seems like it’s going better, so I intend to keep making content.</p>
<p>As for profits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vue.js: The Composition API ($1577 Udemy, $2950 Personal Website) = $4527
</li>
<li>Vue.js Crash Course ($1393 Udemy, $442 Personal Website) = $1835
</li>
<li>Design Patterns for Vue.js ($1439 Gumroad)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: ~$7800.</p>
<p>Of course there are expenses. </p>
<ul>
<li>Vimeo plus account: $110 / year
</li>
<li>Hosting (Digital Ocean) around $10 a month: $100 / year
</li>
<li>Design work for book cover: $150 
</li>
<li>A LOT OF TIME. Probably a 400 hours on content creation alone.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: ~$400</p>
<p>Considering how much time I invested in creating my content, I’d estimate my hourly wage at around $15. I learned a huge amount and had a lot of fun - it was definitely worth it! I intend to continue exploring content creation opportunities in the future, mainly focusing on Udemy and YouTube.</p>
<p>I’m really proud of how far I came this year. That said, my content creation journey really started in 2017 with my blog and the Vue Testing Handbook - it’s unlikely I could have seen this success starting from scratch this year.</p>
<h2>Conclusion and Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I love making educational content - both video and written. I was also able to use this to build my personal brand, and make a bit of extra money on the side during 2020. I hope to continue building my brand, and hopefully earning some money on the side moving into 2021.</p>
